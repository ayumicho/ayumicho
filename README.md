# Hello, I am Ayumi ₍^. .^₎Ⳋ
I'm a third-year Applied Data Science & AI student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, currently doing an AI internship at Achmea. My background spans data science, business, and media production, which gives me a broad perspective on building practical AI solutions.

I enjoy working on projects that sit at the intersection of data engineering and machine learning — from building ETL pipelines and dashboards to deploying models in real-world settings. Outside of tech, I'm fascinated by neuroscience, aerospace, and astronomy — I like understanding things from the ground up.
